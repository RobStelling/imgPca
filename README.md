# What are the visuals of imgPca ?

imgPca splits the screen in two parts, the top part is used to visualize the normalized images, the converted images with the desired alpha and the eigenvectors.
The lower part is used to visualy interact with the S vector and select the appropriate alpha values.
Images are recovered on the fly on the top screen whenever a new number of features is selected.
